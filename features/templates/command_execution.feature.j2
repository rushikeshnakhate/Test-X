Feature: Command Execution Tests for {{ service_type }} Services

  Background:
    Given I have a {{ service_type }} service
    And I have the following service configuration:
      | service_name | {{ service_name }} |
      | timeout      | {{ timeout }}      |

  Scenario: Execute {{ command }} command on {{ service_name }} service
    When I execute the "{{ command }}" command
    Then the command should execute successfully
    And I should see the expected output
    And the command should complete within {{ timeout }} seconds

  Scenario: Execute {{ command }} command with invalid service name
    Given I have an invalid service name
    When I execute the "{{ command }}" command
    Then the command should fail
    And I should see an error message
    And the error should be handled gracefully
